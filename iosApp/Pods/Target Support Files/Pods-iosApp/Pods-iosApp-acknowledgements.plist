      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Под Последующим разработчиком подразумевается Лицензиар или физическое или юридическое лицо от имени которого Лицензиаром была получена Последующая разработка и впоследствии включена в Произведение.
2. Предоставление лицензии на авторское право. В рамках данной Лицензии, каждый Последующий разработчик предоставляет Вам бессрочную, универсальную, неисключительную, свободную, неотзываемую лицензию на воспроизведение, открытую демонстрацию, открытое использование, сублицензирование и распространение Произведения и Производных произведений в форме источника или объекта.
3. Предоставление патентной лицензии. В рамках данной Лицензии, каждый Последующий разработчик предоставляет Вам бессрочную, универсальную, неисключительную, свободную, неотзываемую (за исключением положений, приведенных в данном отделе) патентную лицензию на изготовление, заказ на изготовление, использование, предложение о продаже, продажу, импорт или передачу Произведения, в тех случаях, когда лицензия относится только к патентным притязаниям, лицензируемыми Последующим разработчиком, и которые нарушают права своими Последующими разработками или сочетанием из Последующих разработок и Произведения к которому эти Последующие разработки были представлены. Если вы начинаете патентный спор против любой организации (включая встречный или перекрестный иск в судебном процессе) утверждая, что Произведение или Последующая разработка содержит прямое или косвенное нарушение патентного права, то любая патентная лицензия переданная Вам согласно данной Лицензии на это Произведение прекращает действовать с момента подачи документов о патентном споре.
4. Распространение. Вы можете воспроизводить и распространять копии Произведения и его Производных произведений с изменениями или без, в форме источника или объекта, принимая во внимание то, что Вы действуете согласно следующим условиям:

 • Любые измененные Вами файлы должны содержать хорошо заметную пометку, что они были изменены, а также
 • При дальнейшем распространении формы источника любых Производных произведений должны сохраняться все заявления об авторских правах, патентах, товарных знаках и упоминаниях, присутствующие в форме источника Произведения, за исключением тех заявлений, которые не касаются любой части Производных произведений, и
 • Если Произведение содержит текстовый файл «Уведомление», то любые Производные произведения, которые Вы распространяете, должны включать его удобочитаемую копию, за исключением тех заявлений, которые не касаются любой части Производных произведений, по крайней мере, копия должна находиться в одном из следующих мест: в текстовом файле «Notice», распространяемом как часть Производных произведений; в форме источника или документации, если таковая предоставляется наряду с Производными произведениями; или в процессе отображения, создаваемого, в случае если и где бы эти сторонние заявления не появились. Содержимое файла «Notice» предоставляется только для информационных целей и не изменяет Лицензию. Вы можете добавить Ваши собственные уведомления об использовании торгового знака в Производные произведения, которые Вы распространяете, наряду с или как приложение к тексту Notice, принимая во внимание, что подобные дополнительные уведомления не могут быть истолкованы как изменение Лицензии.
Вы можете добавить к изменениям Ваше собственное заявление об авторских правах и можете предоставить дополнительные или другие лицензионные условия для использования, копирования или распространения Ваших модификаций, или для использования Производных произведений в целом, при условии, что Вы используете, копируете и распространяете Произведение в соответствии с условиями, изложенными в данной Лицензии.
5. Представление Последующих разработок. Если Вы явно не утверждаете другого, любая Последующая разработка, намеренно представленная Вами Лицензиару для включения в Произведение, должна соответствовать условиям данной Лицензии, исключая любые дополнительные условия. Несмотря на вышеизложенное, ничто в данном документе не может заместить или изменить условия отдельного лицензионного соглашения, которое вы могли заключить с Лицензиаром относительно Последующих разработок.

8. Ограничение ответственности. Ни при каких условиях Последующий разработчик не несет ответственности перед Вами за убытки, включая любые прямые, косвенные, умышленные, случайные или последующие убытки любого характера проистекающие из данного Лицензионного соглашения или из использования или невозможности использования Произведения (включая, но не ограничиваясь, убытками, возникшими в результате потери деловой репутации, прекращении работы, аварии или неисправности или любых коммерческих убытков или потерь) даже если Последующий разработчик был предупрежден о возможности такого ущерба.
9. Принятие гарантийных обязательств или Дополнительные обязательства. В процессе распространения копий Произведения и его Производных произведений, Вы можете предложить и взимать плату за принятие обязательств по предоставлению поддержки, гарантийных обязательств, гарантии от убытков и других обязательств по ответственности и/или прав в соответствии с данной Лицензией. Тем не менее, принимая на себя подобные обязательства, Вы можете действовать только от своего собственного имени и на свою исключительную ответственность, не от имени любого другого Последующего разработчика, и только в случае, если вы согласны урегулировать, возместить убытки и защитить каждого Последующего разработчика от навлеченной ответственности и претензий, предъявленных Последующему разработчику, на основании принятия вами гарантийных обязательств или дополнительной ответственности.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Термин «Производные произведения» означает произведение, в форме источника или объекта, которое основано на (или получено из) произведении и по отношению к которому все редакторские правки, примечания, уточнения, или другие изменения, представляют в целом авторское произведение. Понятие Производные произведения не включает в себя произведения, которые обособлены от, или только связаны (или связаны по наименованию) с интерфейсами Произведения или его Производных произведений.
«Последующая разработка» означает любое авторское произведение, включая исходную версию Произведения и любые изменения или дополнения к данному Произведению или его Производным произведениям, которые были намерено представлены Лицензиару для включения в Произведение владельцем авторского права или физическим или юридическим лицом, уполномоченным представлять изменения на правах владельца авторских прав. В рамках данного определения «представление» означает информацию в электронном, устном или письменном виде, отправленную Лицензиару или его представителям, включая, но не ограничиваясь передачей информации по электронной почте, через систему контроля исходного кода и систему контроля версий, под управлением или на правах Лицензиара с целью обсуждения и улучшения Произведения, но исключая информацию, которая выделена или письменно обозначена владельцем авторского права как «Не являющаяся Последующей разработкой».
Под Последующим разработчиком подразумевается Лицензиар или физическое или юридическое лицо от имени которого Лицензиаром была получена Последующая разработка и впоследствии включена в Произведение.
2. Предоставление лицензии на авторское право. В рамках данной Лицензии, каждый Последующий разработчик предоставляет Вам бессрочную, универсальную, неисключительную, свободную, неотзываемую лицензию на воспроизведение, открытую демонстрацию, открытое использование, сублицензирование и распространение Произведения и Производных произведений в форме источника или объекта.
3. Предоставление патентной лицензии. В рамках данной Лицензии, каждый Последующий разработчик предоставляет Вам бессрочную, универсальную, неисключительную, свободную, неотзываемую (за исключением положений, приведенных в данном отделе) патентную лицензию на изготовление, заказ на изготовление, использование, предложение о продаже, продажу, импорт или передачу Произведения, в тех случаях, когда лицензия относится только к патентным притязаниям, лицензируемыми Последующим разработчиком, и которые нарушают права своими Последующими разработками или сочетанием из Последующих разработок и Произведения к которому эти Последующие разработки были представлены. Если вы начинаете патентный спор против любой организации (включая встречный или перекрестный иск в судебном процессе) утверждая, что Произведение или Последующая разработка содержит прямое или косвенное нарушение патентного права, то любая патентная лицензия переданная Вам согласно данной Лицензии на это Произведение прекращает действовать с момента подачи документов о патентном споре.
4. Распространение. Вы можете воспроизводить и распространять копии Произведения и его Производных произведений с изменениями или без, в форме источника или объекта, принимая во внимание то, что Вы действуете согласно следующим условиям:
 • Вы должны предоставить копию данной Лицензии любому получившему Произведение или Производные произведения, и
 • Любые измененные Вами файлы должны содержать хорошо заметную пометку, что они были изменены, а также
 • При дальнейшем распространении формы источника любых Производных произведений должны сохраняться все заявления об авторских правах, патентах, товарных знаках и упоминаниях, присутствующие в форме источника Произведения, за исключением тех заявлений, которые не касаются любой части Производных произведений, и
 • Если Произведение содержит текстовый файл «Уведомление», то любые Производные произведения, которые Вы распространяете, должны включать его удобочитаемую копию, за исключением тех заявлений, которые не касаются любой части Производных произведений, по крайней мере, копия должна находиться в одном из следующих мест: в текстовом файле «Notice», распространяемом как часть Производных произведений; в форме источника или документации, если таковая предоставляется наряду с Производными произведениями; или в процессе отображения, создаваемого, в случае если и где бы эти сторонние заявления не появились. Содержимое файла «Notice» предоставляется только для информационных целей и не изменяет Лицензию. Вы можете добавить Ваши собственные уведомления об использовании торгового знака в Производные произведения, которые Вы распространяете, наряду с или как приложение к тексту Notice, принимая во внимание, что подобные дополнительные уведомления не могут быть истолкованы как изменение Лицензии.
Вы можете добавить к изменениям Ваше собственное заявление об авторских правах и можете предоставить дополнительные или другие лицензионные условия для использования, копирования или распространения Ваших модификаций, или для использования Производных произведений в целом, при условии, что Вы используете, копируете и распространяете Произведение в соответствии с условиями, изложенными в данной Лицензии.
5. Представление Последующих разработок. Если Вы явно не утверждаете другого, любая Последующая разработка, намеренно представленная Вами Лицензиару для включения в Произведение, должна соответствовать условиям данной Лицензии, исключая любые дополнительные условия. Несмотря на вышеизложенное, ничто в данном документе не может заместить или изменить условия отдельного лицензионного соглашения, которое вы могли заключить с Лицензиаром относительно Последующих разработок.
6. Товарные знаки. Данная Лицензия не дает разрешения на использование торговых наименований, товарных знаков, знаков услуг или названий продуктов, принадлежащих Лицензиару, исключая ситуацию, когда они могут потребоваться для обоснованного и обычного использования при описании источника Произведения и воспроизведении содержимого файла Notice.
7. Отказ от гарантийных обязательств. Лицензиар предоставляет Произведение (и каждый Последующий разработчик предоставляет Последующие разработки) "КАК ЕСТЬ" и любые явные или неявные гарантии, включая, без ограничений, гарантии ПРАВ СОБСТВЕННОСТИ, НЕНАРУШЕНИЕ ПРАВ, КОММЕРЧЕСКОЙ ПРИГОДНОСТИ И ПРИГОДНОСТИ ДЛЯ ОПРЕДЕЛЕННОЙ ЦЕЛИ, ОТВЕРГАЮТСЯ. Вы несете ответственность исключительно за определение пригодности использования или распределения Произведения и принимаете любые риски связанные с осуществлением полномочий по данному Лицензионному соглашению.
8. Ограничение ответственности. Ни при каких условиях Последующий разработчик не несет ответственности перед Вами за убытки, включая любые прямые, косвенные, умышленные, случайные или последующие убытки любого характера проистекающие из данного Лицензионного соглашения или из использования или невозможности использования Произведения (включая, но не ограничиваясь, убытками, возникшими в результате потери деловой репутации, прекращении работы, аварии или неисправности или любых коммерческих убытков или потерь) даже если Последующий разработчик был предупрежден о возможности такого ущерба.
9. Принятие гарантийных обязательств или Дополнительные обязательства. В процессе распространения копий Произведения и его Производных произведений, Вы можете предложить и взимать плату за принятие обязательств по предоставлению поддержки, гарантийных обязательств, гарантии от убытков и других обязательств по ответственности и/или прав в соответствии с данной Лицензией. Тем не менее, принимая на себя подобные обязательства, Вы можете действовать только от своего собственного имени и на свою исключительную ответственность, не от имени любого другого Последующего разработчика, и только в случае, если вы согласны урегулировать, возместить убытки и защитить каждого Последующего разработчика от навлеченной ответственности и претензий, предъявленных Последующему разработчику, на основании принятия вами гарантийных обязательств или дополнительной ответственности.
